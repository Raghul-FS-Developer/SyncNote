Great 👌 let’s turn your project description into a **polished GitHub README template**.
This structure will impress interviewers/recruiters because it clearly explains **what it is, how it works, and how to run it**.

# 📄 Collaborative Editor

A real-time collaborative editor where multiple users can work on the same shared document.
The key requirement was:
👉 **when one user edits a line, it should be locked so that no other user can edit the same line until it is released.**

In addition, the editor has been enhanced to support **live document updates** so that every user sees changes instantly, keeping the document fully synchronized.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔒 **Line-level locking** – ensures only one user can edit a line at a time
* ⚡ **Live updates** – any change is instantly visible to all users
* 👥 **Multi-user support** – multiple collaborators can work in real-time
* 🔗 **Socket.IO integration** – bi-directional event-based communication
* 🖥️ **React-based UI** – clean, simple, and responsive interface

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Socket.IO
* **Runtime:** Node.js

## 📷 Demo

*(You can add a screenshot or a short GIF here showing two users editing together)*

👉 This README not only explains your **thinking** but also makes it easy for anyone (including interviewers) to **clone and try your project**.

Do you want me to also **write the GIF demo creation steps** (like using `screen-recorder` + `gifify`) so you can add a live collaboration preview in the README? That really impresses recruiters.
